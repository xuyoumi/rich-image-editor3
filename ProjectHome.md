# Image Editor v3.0. #

Last year, I wrote an Image Editor for a different project with the intention of allowing users to manually edit their own profiles' image... It was pretty basic and stand alone (no ExtJS)... http://www.LoreZyra.com/!Admin/ImageEditor (v2.2)


Now, I'm working to port it over and upgrade it's feature set! When I have a full dev version working, I'll post the code here...


For now, check out my demo site: http://www.LoreZyra.com/!Admin/ (just hit the login button)

I do welcome suggestions and requests...
